COGS,,Processing Costs,,"In our operation, we use two main fund processing models: Processor Gateway and Transfer Gateway. Both apply to Wallet deposit (fund collection) and Withdrawals (fund withdrawals), depending on the money flow structure.
• 1. Processor Gateway
This model operates through external providers for payment processing, who facilitate the collection or withdrawal of funds through different methods available in the application.
Processor Gateway Modalities:
    ◦ Traditional: The user chooses from multiple payment methods integrated into the wallet, which are processed through internal Gateways at an operational and technological level, and these fund movements are then processed by external PSPs.
    ◦ Full Gateway: It differs in that the integration is direct with the merchant, by passing the wallet, processing funds directly on the client's platform.
🔹 Cost considerations: In this scheme, costs are usually tied to a percentage of processed volume, which can represent a less efficient cost structure when volumes are high. This is because intermediaries may apply risk management surcharges and processing fees.
• 2. Transfer Gateway
This model is based on providing own accounts for users, where they can deposit or withdraw money directly through specific local methods (example: bank transfers, PIX, SPEI). In this scheme, the fintech acts as BaaS (Banking as a Service), allowing users to interact with their balance without depending on external processors.
🔹 Key benefit: In our operation, Transfer Gateway has generated a significant cost reduction, since, despite involving some fixed costs per account and KYC validations, these are diluted with processing volume, resulting in a much more efficient alternative."
COGS,,Expatriations,,"• Expatriation: Cost for transferring funds from local markets to international accounts. Spread applied by brokers according to the market or PSPs at the official exchange rate in the transfer.
• Spread: Currency conversion costs through our treasury team (can be for operational needs), as well as conversions that don't just occur when moving funds but due to provider particularities, automatically changing the currency for each transaction from local currency to a consolidated currency (e.g., USD) and there, without us intentionally moving those funds, we're already experiencing a spread, this is accounted for within this account."
COGS,,Promotions,,"Expenses incurred from marketing incentives offered to users to drive adoption, engagement, or transaction volume within the digital wallet. This includes costs such as cashback, discounts, vouchers, bonus credits, or rewards that directly reduce revenue or increase transaction-related expenses, and therefore are recognized as part of the company’s cost of goods sold."
COGS,,Bank Fees,,"Fees for operations and maintenance of bank accounts. For both local and international banks, these would be all the banks we use for the flow of funds within the company and the associated costs; payment of bills, payment to providers/services, settlements to clients, etc."
COGS,,Other Costs,,"A category of operating expenses that captures transaction-related and customer-driven costs not classified under core processing or promotional expenses. This includes items such as bad debts, referral and affiliate fees, cashout commissions, and chargebacks, which directly impact the company’s gross margin but do not fall within primary processing costs."
COGS,,Processing Costs,Payins,"Funds added to a digital wallet by a user through various funding methods such as bank transfers, credit or debit cards, cash deposits, or alternative local payment methods. Payins represent the inflow of money into the wallet, enabling users to hold a balance and perform subsequent transactions."
COGS,,Processing Costs,Payouts,"Funds withdrawn or transferred from a digital wallet to an external destination, such as a user’s bank account, card, or local payment method. Payouts represent the outflow of money from the wallet, allowing users to access their funds outside the wallet ecosystem."
COGS,,Processing Costs,Other Processing Costs,"These are costs that are not easily attributable to users or transactions. Account maintenance fees, charges for rejected or canceled transactions, among others."
COGS,,Processing Costs,Debit Cards,"Cost associated with debit card processing. We have different types of expenses depending on the provider, but most expenses can be:
1. Physical card (one-time purchase cost including packaging and delivery)
2. Virtual card (this has a monthly maintenance cost)
3. Processing by the Issuing provider (Approved/rejected transactions), we could also include fixed or minimum costs for operating with the provider. Ex: 10K USD + VAT per month - Pomelo.
4. Card tokenization.
5. KYC (User validation required by the provider), in most cases done once at issuance/creation. In some cases, it's more periodic due to certain compliance restrictions."
COGS,,Processing Costs,Bill Payments,"The cost is almost null, there isn't much margin and it operates on a revenue share scheme with the incorporation of large volume."
COGS,,Processing Costs,Savings,The expenses incurred by the company to provide and maintain the Savings product for users. This includes costs associated with funding interest or yield paid to users and fees related to managing the underlying financial instruments or partners.
COGS,,Processing Costs,Messaging,Costs of transactional notifications and communications to users with providers like Telesign and Twilio.
COGS,,Processing Costs,KYC,"Identity verification costs with providers like Onfido, Incode, etc. It arises from the moment when the user is onboarding in the application, the selfie that validates with the document, etc. This process has a cost and we call it KYC."
COGS,,Promotions,Promos,"Promotions we run to acquire or retain users, for example, cashbacks."
COGS,,Promotions,AstroPoints,"This is a strategy designed to incentivize customer loyalty. Users accumulate points for different transactions and then they can redeemed for experiences,balance in the wallet,etc."
COGS,,Other Costs,Bad Debts,"Failed releases largely due to integrations with BUGS when going to production, as well as existing integrations that underwent code changes over time or were exploited belatedly. On the other hand, we also have fund freezing by banks/processors, mostly in local markets and with risk that often due to risk we end up losing all funds without being able to appeal anything, in other cases a lawsuit is triggered through lawyers, etc. (well-known case of PayU in 2021)"
COGS,,Other Costs,Affiliates,Commissions for acquiring new users. Affiliates usually have a user portfolio and we pay a commission according to the affiliate/sub-affiliate for the processing generated by their portfolio in the wallet.
COGS,,Other Costs,Cashout Commissions,"Incentives to merchants to promote withdrawals, reducing expatriation costs. The idea is for money to remain in the Astropay ecosystem and avoid moving funds (which would generate additional expenses) operating in a more optimal way."
COGS,,Other Costs,Chargebacks,"Refunds for user disputes, mainly on credit cards. The fraud team is responsible for mitigating this risk by applying fraud rules per provider to reduce the occurrence of chargebacks. "
